# Goodbuzz System

## Installation

This uses [templ](https://github.com/a-h/templ) for templating and [air](https://github.com/air-verse/air) for live-reloading development.
Follow the installation instructions for both.

Once these are installed, use the makefile to build and run the program:

- `make` / `make live` - start the hot-reloading dev version
- `make build` - build the production version
- `make prod` - build and run the production  version
- `make clean` - remove all build artifacts
